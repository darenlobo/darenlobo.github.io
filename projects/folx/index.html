            <h2>Designing the UI</h2>
            <div class="articlewrapper">
              <div class="maintxt">
                <p>I went about designing the UI for the app using a systematic building block approach. Working closely with the team, I started by building the most basic elements first, and then building up to larger, more complex pieces.</p><br><br>
                <h3><r>The Atoms</r></h3>
                <p>The building blocks were designed to convey <r>structure</r>, <r>reliability</r>, <r>security</r>, but also <r>playfulness</r> and <r>fun</r>. The pink accents added a cute, <r>funky</r> element to the design.</p>
                <img src="ui-atoms.png"></img><br><br>
                <h3><r>The Molecules</r></h3>
                <p>As I scaled up, I had a lot of fun playing around with the Icebreakers. I saw a lot of potential with randomizing them and motivating users to talk about themselves in a playful and creative way. The switches also have a sharp uniqueness to them that I thought was a nice quirk of the design.</p>

                <h3><r>The Organisms</r></h3>
                <p>Putting these pieces together was made simple by the approach I had taken and it helped me quickly build the UI without any hassles. The end product was fun, quirky, and playful, reflecting the creative geniuses of the team, and of course, the awesome people who would use the app to find their special someone.</p>
                <img src="ui-orgs.png"></img>
                <p>All in all, this was a brisk, enjoyable project that taught me how to collaborate with a closely knit team from afar, quickly becoming a part of the inner circle, and seamlessly integrating with them.</p><img src="ui-screens.png"></img>

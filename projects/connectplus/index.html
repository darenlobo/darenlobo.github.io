For emphasis and uniformity, posts are displayed in fixed card sizes, which have common features such as header and footer, and a content space that can be customized by the designer. The other important features are the members directory, chat inbox and notices - prioritized posts by admins.</p>

Being a quick learner, <r>Shinu Shaju</r> quickly caught up to speed and understood the ins and outs of ConnectPlus’s design. To cement the design style and keep it future proof, I documented a comprehensive, flexible design system. This documentation clearly defined the existing micro apps and the framework for designing new ones.</p>

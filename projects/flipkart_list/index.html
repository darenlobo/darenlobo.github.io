          <h3>Key Highlights</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>I proposed, defined and successfully launched this wholly design-initiated project, to appeal to Flipkart users living in Tier 2 / Tier 3 areas who are not yet comfortable buying groceries on our platform.</li>
            <li>As a design initiated project, a lot of my responsibilities lay at the edges of my job description: Product Definition, Product Strategy, Writing a PRD, Coordinating various engineering, research and graphic design resources, and acting as a product owner.</li>
            <li>Users who used a shopping list, added to basket and converted nearly 2x as well.</li>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="articlewrapper">
          <div class="maintxt">
            <p>Flipkart Grocery is a business unit via which we sold dry groceries - such as pulses, oils, flours, and grains, which can be stocked up and therefore are shopped for in bulk, on a monthly basis. The core value proposition for this business lies in the cost efficiency of its supply chain. Unlike the rest of Flipkart with 3rd party sellers, FK Grocery is completely 1st party owned and operated, meaning we own everything from the products, to the shelves, warehouses and supply chains. **This allows us to pack large orders together, and pass on the accrued savings to the user.</p>

            <p>One of the biggest problems I noticed in this user journey is that Flipkart at the time did not provide a feature for a user to maintain a shopping list to keep track of their monthly requirements.</p>

      <h2>Why a shopping list?</h2>
      <div class="articlewrapper">
        <div class="maintxt">
          <h3>We have limited time to convert users</h3><p>27% returning customers just have 1 session a month and 75% of these users don’t do an add to basket. The grocery ‘Aha’ moment where users start to convert is 4 units, however few reach it.</p>
          <img src="images/u2ograph.png"></img>
          <h3>Long list = more cognitive load</h3><p>Users shop for a multi-product list by default and FK Grocery further incentivises this behaviour through tiered basket discounts. (units per order ~10-12).</p>
          <img src="images/userthinking.png"></img>
          <h3>Users are already using lists  in the real world: </h3><p>Traditional grocery shoppers already create handwritten lists to keep track of their grocery shopping, I hypothesised that ingesting this list into Flipkart would be a promising driver for conversion and basket size.</p>

      <h2>Execution & Process</h2>
      <div class="articlewrapper">
        <div class="maintxt">
          <p>Because of the unconventional nature of this project there were multiple phases:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><h4>Initial Ideation & Design:</h4> Being a designer, the fastest way for me to explain my ideas was visually - I explored different ideas for how my list feature should function, refined the overall user flow, and some degree of visual design.</li>
            <li><h4>Writing the PRD:</h4> This forced me out of my comfort zone, forcing me to think of how this feature would be executed - which engineering teams would be needed in order to make this work? What would an MVP scope look like, and what would the long term vision look like? How do I estimate the opportunity size and business impact? what would success look like?</li>
            <li><h4>Pitching to Leadership & refining design:</h4>This was new territory for me - I learned how to convince others with my research, and impress them with my designs. I learned to be patient, and resilient in the face of disappointment. Throughout the process, I kept getting design feedback and iterating on my designs to create the best user flow possible</li>
            <li><h4>Collaboration with PMs, engineers and content:</h4> Once I secured buy-in, I no longer needed to act as a lone wolf - with support from PMs, constant collaboration with engineering to identify minimum requirements and stretch goals, we worked together to take this project from an idea to execution</li>
            <li><h4>Go Live & AB:</h4> After the entire development process, throughout which I supported by sharing relevant assets, clarifying queries, and signing off on releases, we were ready to start our AB. Over the course of this testing phase, we identified opportunities in optimizing the experience - once again, we prioritized these opportunities based on which teams would be required to make changes - wherever it was a smaller matter of changing copy or replacing image assets, I carved out my own bandwidth to create those. I also explored designs for longer term UX improvements which would involve significant engineering efforts, which we expect to go into development later this year.</li>

      <h2>Design Tenets</h2>
      <div class="articlewrapper">
        <div class="maintxt">
          <h3>Entry Points</h3>
          <h4>Discoverability</h4><p>As with all new features, it’s important that the user discover this feature naturally as part of their existing user journey, in a way that drives maximum traffic.</p>
          <h4>Intuitiveness</h4><p>The onboarding experience and first look at the feature should provide the user a way to quickly get up to speed and figure out how to get from “zero to one”</p>
          <h4>Accessibility</h4><p>In order for users to reliably return to the feature, there must be some clear and predictable entry points. A key metric here is the number of taps it takes to get to my shopping list - in an ideal world, it could be as simple as a widget on my device home screen, or using a voice assistant.</p>

          <h3>Input Methods</h3>
          <h4>Flexibility</h4><p>A user should be able to express themselves in a manner that is intuitive to them. Since Flipkart’s typical user base tend to be uncomfortable with typing in English, other methods are important to ensure ease of use.</p>
          <h4>Scalability</h4><p>A user should be able to import multiple items into their list at once - by pasting comma separated items, scanning a paper list, or speaking out the list.</p>
          <h4>Helpfulness</h4><p>The input should help the user when they are struggling to spell something right, or recall exactly what they need</p>
          
          <h3></h3>
          <h4>Proximity</h4><p>The input field should be proximal to the keyboard as well as the list, helping the user see what they’re typing as well as how it gets added to the list. </p>
          <h4>Familiarity</h4><p>It’s said that a user spends most of their time not using your app. The ideal layout for this feature should leverage mental models built by Whatsapp and other messaging apps</p>
          <h4>Linear Flow</h4><p>When you write a list on paper, the list flows from top to bottom. Does that need to be the case in a digital list? Consider Google Assistant’s native shopping list: The list input is at the top, and entries are ranked from oldest to newest. This is in stark contrast to their own note taking app, Google Keep, which orients the list in a more natural order. (As of writing this, Google has sunset their Assistant’s list functionality, directing you to use Keep instead)</p>
          <h4>Recency</h4><p>The newest items in the list tend to be the most important, since they’re a mix of urgent and non urgent requirements. </p>
          <h4>Error Correction</h4><p> In case the user makes an error in input, they need to be able to edit and delete items in their list. </p>

          <p>From these we can derive a series of constraints for our list.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>We want the list input and ,  We want our **list input** trigger closer to the thumb so it’s always accessible</li>
              <li>We want to (if possible) match the way people write</li>
              <li>We assume recent information is more relevant</li>
            </ul>

      <h2>Learnings & Challenges</h2>
      <div class="articlewrapper">
        <div class="maintxt">
          <p>The challenges in this project were mainly around stakeholder management and in securing buy-in from engineering to make this a reality. Because i initiated this project as a designer and challenged the conventional product roadmapping approach at Flipkart, there was a significant learning curve when it came to estimating business impact, convincing stakeholders of the value of the project, etc</p>

          <p>Being the initiator of the project, I had to explore and solve problems far from the “typical” role of a designer - how do you write a PRD? how do you define and estimate success? How do you convince leadership to invest engineering bandwidth into your project? How do you resolve disputes between various stakeholders? While this learning was enormous, I was eventually supported in my efforts when a PM and engineering team was assigned. The PM and I collaborated extensively to refine the product vision, coordinate teams and align stakeholders.  My design leadership too played a role by providing constant feedback and support when navigating bureaucracy.</p>
          <blockquote>Looking back, this project taught me how to go beyond my role, and drive impact at a product strategy and roadmapping level. It taught me that as a designer, my ideas can make a real difference to the overall direction of the product.</blockquote>
